KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) BBM Integration Sample App for BlackBerry 10.

This app makes it easy to add BBM Integration to your WebWorks app.

Credits
This sample wouldn't have been possible without the totally awesome bbUI project (https://github.com/blackberry/bbUI.js), the pre-existing BBM sample by Erik Oros (https://github.com/oros), and of course the hard work by the entire WebWorks team.
The icons in this app come from the Tango Icon Library (http://tango.freedesktop.org/), a Public Domain iconset. 

Truthfully, Erik's sample is much more impressive than this one, and contains several features that I didn't bother including. However, I think this sample is easier to rip the needed code from and drop it into your own app. I spent several hours figuring out how Erik's sample worked before I was able to make this one (although that's more a reflection on my nonexistant formal code learning than a reflection on the difficulty of Erik's sample). This sample is geared more towards helping the newest developer can quickly and easily integrate BBM with their BB10 apps.
