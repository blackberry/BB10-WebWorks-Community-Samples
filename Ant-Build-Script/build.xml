	<!-- Default Build - Change as needed to the sdk and build properties you want:
	build.test (build in all SDKs+Ripple with WebInspector, source output, and debug token for Tablet and BB10)
	build.prod (build in all SDKs+Ripple with signing and no debugging, and a build id number for Tablet and BB10)
	build.beta (build in all SDKs+Ripple with signing _and_ debugging, and a build id number for Tablet and BB10)
	build.ripple (deploy to your file system for serving up in Ripple)

	Specific builds follow the pattern:
	build.[bbos, tablet, bb10].[test, prod, beta]
	- use bbos for BlackBerry 5 through 7.x smartphones
	- tablet for PlayBook 1.x through 2.x
	- bb10 for BlackBerry 10

	- use test for WebInspector, source output, and debug tokens. Java builds will only run on simulators.
	- use prod for regular signing with a build id and no debugging.
	- use beta for regular signing with a build id and WebInspector turned on.

	Lint/Hint and Minify targets can be included before the build here
	build.optimize runs both lint and minify tasks
	build.lint runs jslint, jshint and csslint
	build.minify concatenates and minifies the JS and CSS files

	Debug Tokens can be created and deployed using the following commands:
	build.[createDebugToken, deployDebugToken].[bb10, tablet]
	- the Debug Token will be created for the Device Pins listed in the device.[bb10, tablet].pin property.
	- for BB10, it will deploy to the correct directory, but the Tablet SDK requires modifying the bbwp.properties file in the SDK.

	Deployment commands follow the pattern:
	build.deploy.[bb10.[device, sim], tablet, bbos].[test, prod, beta]
	- bb10, tablet, bbos as defined above
	- only for bb10 builds, use device for real devices and sim for VMWare based simulators
	- test, prod, beta to load the matching build created above

	You can add targets into the build flow using the following extension points. Use the "extensionOf" attribute

	build.Started - no actions yet taken
	build.Initialized - Build directories created, no files copied
	build.FilesReady - App files are copied into the build directory
	build.ZipBuilt - The zip has been created from the files in the build directory
