# NowPlaying #

The [BlackBerry 10 Cordova Plugin] (https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks-Community-APIs/tree/master/BB11-Cordova/NowPlaying) plays music in the background. 
This is a sample app that uses the plugin.

## Applies To ##

* [BlackBerry 10 WebWorks SDK](https://developer.blackberry.com/html5/download/sdk)

## Author(s) ##

* [Tim Windsor] (https://github.com/timwindsor)

* [John Hsu] (https://github.com/Makoz)

## Building and running the sample app

In the console, run:

1. rm -rf debug1
2. cordova create debug1
3. cd debug1
4. cordova plugin add https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks-Community-APIs.git#:/BB10-Cordova/NowPlaying/plugin
   (or if that does not work because the below isn't pulled to that link yet, run the below instead)
cordova plugin add https://github.com/parker-mar/WebWorks-Community-APIs.git#:/BB10-Cordova/NowPlaying/plugin
5. rm -rf www/
6. cp ../config.xml ./
7. cp -r ../www/ ./www
8. (Instructions:) Import the native extension project into Momentics, with root directory as `/plugins/com.blackberry.community.nowplaying/src/blackberry10/native`.
In the Momentics IDE, right click the project: under "Build Configurations", select "Clean All" then "Build All". (This should build cleanly with potentially only warnings).
9. cordova platform add blackberry10
10. cordova run

The app should now be running.

### Object Methods ###

#### NowPlayingRequestPlayback() ####
Sets up the app for playing music and binds callbacks to the app.

@param input: a json object with methods that callback to the app.
The callback methods that must be specified are:

	- play: Fired when the track is played.
	- pause: Fired when the track is paused.
	- stop: Fired when the track is stopped.
	- next: Fired when the next track is invoked. Callback must invoke com.blackberry.community.nowplaying.play()
			with arguments for the next track.
	- previous: Fired when the previous track is invoked. Callback must invoke com.blackberry.community.nowplaying.play()
				with arguments for the previous track.
	- error: Fired when an internal error occurs.

@returns String: whether playback was requested (set up) successfully.

Example:

	var requestPlaybackButtonClick = function() {
		var jsonData = {
			play: sampleAsyncCallback,
			pause: sampleAsyncCallback,
			stop: sampleAsyncCallback,
			next: nextCallback,
			previous: previousCallback,
			error: sampleAsyncCallback
		};

		com.blackberry.community.nowplaying.NowPlayingRequestPlayback(jsonData);
	};

	var sampleAsyncCallback = function(data) {
		if (data) {
			console.log(data);
		}
	};

	var nextCallback = function(data) {
		sampleAsyncCallback(data);

		// Move track pointer.
		if (myTrackPointer < myPlaylist.length - 1) {
			myTrackPointer++;

			// Play the next track.
			play(myPlaylist, myTrackPointer);
		} else {
			console.log("At last track: can't go next.");
		}
	};

	var previousCallback = function(data) {
		sampleAsyncCallback(data);

		// Move track pointer.
		if (myTrackPointer > 0) {
			myTrackPointer--;

			// Play the previous track.
			play(myPlaylist, myTrackPointer);
		} else {
			console.log("At first track: can't go previous.");
		}
	};
