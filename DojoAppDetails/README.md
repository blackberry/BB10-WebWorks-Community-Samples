# Dojo Sample Application

This application shows the markup for creating a simple Dojo application to view app details based on the app's WebWorks config.xml file

The sample code for this application is Open Source under the [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).


**Applies To**

* [BlackBerry WebWorks SDK for BB10](https://developer.blackberry.com/html5/)


**Author(s)** 

* Michelle Mendoza


**Dependencies**

* When running the application on a device/computer, an internet connection is required to access the Dojo toolkit resources

**Known Issues**

* When using the Ripple Emulator, a Chrome Console log error is shown: "Uncaught Error: undefinedModule". This is due to Dojo trying to load Ripple's "ripple/bootstrap" since it follows the same Dojo syntax for loading legacy modules e.g. require("ripple/bootstrap")

**Tested On**
* BlackBerry 10 Dev Alpha 10.0.6.671

## How to Build

To build the DojoAppDetails sample application:

1. Click on the **Downloads** tab above.
2. Select **Download as zip** (Windows) or **Download as tar.gz** (Mac) and save the downloaded file to your local machine.
3. Create a new folder on your local machine named **DojoAppDetails** e.g. **C:\Documents and Settings\User\WebWorks\DojoAppDetails** (Windows) or **~/WebWorks/DojoAppDetails** (Mac).
4. Open the downloaded ZIP file from step 2 and extract the contents **from inside the zipped DojoAppDetails folder** to your local **DojoAppDetails** folder from step 3.  This ensures that the necessary application assets, such as **config.xml**, are correctly located at the top level of the local **DojoAppDetails** folder (e.g. **~/WebWorks/DojoAppDetails/config.xml**).
5. Using the **[Ripple Mobile Emulator](http://developer.blackberry.com/html5/download)** and the **[BlackBerry WebWorks SDK for BB10](http://developer.blackberry.com/html5/download)**, package the contents of your local **DojoAppDetails** folder into a BlackBerry application.  Enter the project root settings field as the local folder created in step 3, and the archive name settings field as **DojoAppDetails**.
