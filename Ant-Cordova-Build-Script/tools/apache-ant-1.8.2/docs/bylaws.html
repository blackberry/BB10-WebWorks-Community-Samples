      Apache Ant&#x2122; Project Bylaws
    </h3>
                        <p>
      This document defines the bylaws under which the Apache Ant project
      operates. It defines the roles and responsibilities of the
      project, who may vote, how voting works, how conflicts are resolved,
      etc.
    </p>
                                <p>
      Ant is a project of the
      <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/">Apache Software
      Foundation</a>.  The foundation holds the copyright on Apache
      code including the code in the  Ant codebase. The
      <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/faq.html">foundation FAQ</a>
      explains the operation and background of the foundation.
    </p>
                                <p>
      Ant is typical of Apache projects in that it operates under a set of
      principles, known collectively as the "Apache Way". If you are
      new to Apache development, please refer to the
      <a href="http://incubator.apache.org">Incubator project</a>
      for more information on how Apache projects operate. <b>Note:</b> the
      incubator project has only been recently set up and does not yet explain
      the Apache Way in great detail.

      Roles and Responsibilities
    </h3>
                        <p>
      Apache projects define a set of roles with associated rights and
      responsibilities. These roles govern what tasks an individual may perform
      within the project. The roles are defined in the following sections
    </p>
                                <ul>

                                      <h4 class="subsection">
        <a name="Users"></a>
        Users
      </h4>
                        <p>
        The most important participants in the project are people who use our
        software. The majority of our developers start out as users and guide
        their development efforts from the user's perspective.
      </p>
                                <p>
        Users contribute to the Apache projects by providing feedback to
        developers in the form of bug reports and feature suggestions. As
        well, users participate in the Apache community by helping other users
        on mailing lists and user support forums.
      </p>
                                                          <h4 class="subsection">

        Developers
      </h4>
                        <p>
        All of the volunteers who are contributing time, code, documentation,
        or resources to the Ant Project. A developer that makes sustained,
        welcome contributions to the project may be invited to become a
        Committer, though the exact timing of such invitations depends on many
        factors.
      </p>
                                                          <h4 class="subsection">
        <a name="Committers"></a>
        Committers
      </h4>
                        <p>
        The project's Committers are responsible for the project's technical
        management. All committers have write access to the project's source
        repositories. Committers may cast binding votes on any technical
        discussion regarding the project.
      </p>
                                <p>
        Committer access is by invitation only and must be approved by lazy
        consensus of the active PMC members. A Committer is considered emeritus
        by their own declaration or by not contributing in any form to the
        project for over six months. An emeritus committer may request
        reinstatement of commit access from the PMC. Such reinstatement is
        subject to lazy consensus of active PMC members.
      </p>
                                <p>
        Commit access can be revoked by a unanimous vote of all the active
        PMC members (except the committer in question if they are also a PMC member).
      </p>
                                <p>
        All Apache committers are required to have a signed Contributor License
        Agreement (CLA) on file with the Apache Software Foundation. There is a

        A committer who makes a sustained contribution to the project may be
        invited to become a member of the PMC. The form of contribution is
        not limited to code. It can also include code review, helping out
        users on the mailing lists, documentation, etc.

        Project Management Committee
      </h4>
                        <p>
        The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Ant was created by a
        <a href="mission.html">resolution</a> of the board of the Apache
        Software Foundation on 18<sup>th</sup> November 2002. The PMC is
        responsible to the board and the ASF for the management and oversight
        of the Apache Ant codebase. The responsibilities of the PMC include
      </p>
                                <ul>
        <li>Deciding what is distributed as products of the Apache Ant project.
            In particular all releases must be approved by the PMC
        </li>
        <li>Maintaining the project's shared resources, including the codebase
            repository, mailing lists, websites.
        </li>
        <li>Speaking on behalf of the project.
        </li>
        <li>Resolving license disputes regarding products of the project
        </li>
        <li>Nominating new PMC members and committers
        </li>
        <li>Maintaining these bylaws and other guidelines of the project
        </li>
      </ul>
                                <p>
        Membership of the PMC is by invitation only and must be approved by a
        lazy consensus of active PMC members. A PMC member is considered
        "emeritus" by their own declaration or by not contributing in
        any form to the project for over six months. An emeritus member may
        request reinstatement to the PMC. Such reinstatement is subject to lazy
        consensus of the active PMC members. Membership of the PMC can be
        revoked by an unanimous vote of all the active PMC members other than
        the member in question.
      </p>
                                <p>
        The chair of the PMC is appointed by the ASF board. The chair is an
        office holder of the Apache Software Foundation (Vice President,
        Apache Ant) and has primary responsibility to the board for the
        management of the projects within the scope of the Ant PMC. The chair
        reports to the board quarterly on developments within the Ant project.
        The PMC may consider the position of PMC chair annually and if
        supported by 2/3 Majority may recommend a new chair to the board.
        Ultimately, however, it is the board's responsibility who it chooses
        to appoint as the PMC chair.

      Decision Making
    </h3>
                        <p>
      Within the Ant project, different types of decisions require different
      forms of approval. For example, the
      <a href="#Roles and Responsibilities">previous section</a> describes
      several decisions which require "lazy consensus" approval. This
      section defines how voting is performed, the types of approvals, and which
      types of decision require which type of approval.

        Voting
      </h4>
                        <p>
        Decisions regarding the project are made by votes on the primary project
        development mailing list (dev@ant.apache.org). Where necessary,
        PMC voting may take place on the private Ant PMC mailing list.
        Votes are clearly indicated by subject line starting with [VOTE] or
        [PMC-VOTE]. Votes may contain multiple items for approval and these
        should be clearly separated. Voting is carried out by replying to the
        vote mail. Voting may take four flavours

        All participants in the Ant project are encouraged to show their
        agreement with or against a particular action by voting. For technical
        decisions, only the votes of active committers are binding. Non binding
        votes are still useful for those with binding votes to understand the
        perception of an action in the wider Ant community. For PMC decisions,
        only the votes of PMC members are binding.
      </p>
                                <p>
        Voting can also be applied to changes made to the Ant codebase. These
        typically take the form of a veto (-1) in reply to the commit message
        sent when the commit is made.

        A valid, binding veto cannot be overruled. If a veto is cast, it must be
        accompanied by a valid reason explaining the reasons for the veto. The
        validity of a veto, if challenged, can be confirmed by anyone who has
        a binding vote. This does not necessarily  signify agreement with the
        veto - merely that the veto is valid.

                                <p>
        If you disagree with a valid veto, you must lobby the person casting
        the veto to withdraw their veto. If a veto is not withdrawn, the action
        that has been vetoed must be reversed in a timely manner.
