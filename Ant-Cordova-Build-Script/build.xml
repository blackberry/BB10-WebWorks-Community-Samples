	<!-- Default Build - Change as needed to the sdk and build properties you want:

	Build and Deploy together using the following commands:
	cordova.device.[test, prod] or cordova.sim.test

	To Build Only use the pattern:
	cordova.build.[test, prod]
	- use test for WebInspector, and debug tokens.
	- use prod for signing with a build id and no debugging.

	Lint/Hint and Minify targets can be included before the build here
	cordova.optimize runs both lint and minify tasks
	cordova.lint runs jslint, jshint and csslint
	cordova.minify concatenates and minifies the JS and CSS files

	Debug Tokens will be created and deployed automatically using the cordova.device.test command.
	
	Deployment commands follow the pattern:
	cordova.[device, sim].[test, prod]
	- use device for real devices and sim for VMWare based simulators
	- test, prod to load the matching build created above

	Use the cordova.cleantargets command to keep your project clean of generated targets (these are automatically created by the script).
	-->
	<target name="build" depends="cordova.device.prod"></target>

	<!-- Add additional Targets here -->

	<!-- Extension Points 
	You can add targets into the build flow using the following extension points. Use the "extensionOf" attribute
	to add to the dependency list

	build.Started - no actions yet taken
	build.Initialized - Environment Variables are set
	build.FilesReady - Targets are set, ready to build
	-->
	<target name="ExtExample" extensionOf="build.FilesReady">
		<echo>Build is about to start</echo>
	</target>
