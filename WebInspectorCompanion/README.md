# Web Inspector Companion

This sample is designed to help demonstrate the various features and capabilities of remote [Web Inspector](https://developer.blackberry.com/html5/documentation/web_inspector_overview_1553586_11.html) for BlackBerry.  It is based off the Built-for-BlackBerry sample template. An earlier version of this application was used as a helper app for [JAM343](https://github.com/blackberry/Presentations/tree/master/2013-BlackBerryJam-Europe/JAM343) presentation delivered at BlackBerry Jam Asia.  Developers are encouraged to follow that tutorial to learn more about web inspector.
